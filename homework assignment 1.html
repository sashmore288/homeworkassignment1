				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
				My name is Sta'Shaun. I was born in Atlanta, Ga. A few of my hobbies are writing, yoga, playing soccer, and cooking. I also love to concoct my own cosmetics such as lotions, soaps, and hair products. My passion is working with babies and children. I hope to one day open my own school focused on balancing technology, outdoor play, and learning life skills.</p>
